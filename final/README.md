How to Test Our Project:

The format of our dates is in year-month-day (yyyy-mm-dd). The time is is in the format of hh:mm (military time), so input 18:30 for (6:30 pm).

Navigate through the application by just inputing the number of each function. For example input 1 for login.

Either login or signup for a new account

We also attached a demo that also walks through some of the detail of how to test our code.
